Simple Node.js cron that checks the Official Romanian Covid Vaccine platform for available slots in your area.

**Usage:**

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. Change the PROFILE_DATA object with your data.
4. `node app.js`

The script will make a request every 30 seconds and it'll notify you once it finds availble slot

## FAQ
**Where do I get the data for the PROFILE_DATA object ? **
This script is already extremly easy to setup and use therefore I'll let you figure that one on your own.
